The space-delimited data file "tidyData.txt" produced by the R-script "run_analysis.R" provides the mean values of accelerometer and gyroscope data acquired from a Samsung smartphone. A group of 30 volunteers are considered, who are each assigned a unique "Participant" ID. The measurements are taken whilst the volunteers are performing various activities. A description of the various data columns are provided here.

The first two column headers are titled "Participant" and "Activity":
    => Participant: A unique integer ID number, assigned to the volunteer
    => Activity:    A character string indicating one of six activities from {WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING}

The remaining columns provide mean values of the mean and standard deviation data obtained in the experiment, in units of 'g' (standard gravity units). A description of the data headings is provided in "UntidyData/features_info.txt". Note that in the data tidying process, these column names have been modified slightly, such that:
    => "-" characters have been replaced by "." characters
    => "()" strings have been replaced by "..." strings
For each of the measurements provided in these remaining columns the type of data can be inferred from by whether they contain the following substrings:
    => total_acc: The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis
    => body_acc:  The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
    => body_gyro: The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second
